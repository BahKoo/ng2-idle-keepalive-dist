[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HackedByChinese/ng2-idle-keepalive.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HackedByChinese/ng2-idle-keepalive)

A plugin for ng2-idle to keep user sessions alive while active.

This module is used to ping a server in the background. It is an optional plugin for `ng2-idle`.

## Design Considerations

The primary application of this module is for session management. Commonly, an authn/authz strategy will involve the application requesting a token (an OAuth bearer token, Forms Auth ticket, or other token system, which could be in cookie form, supplied as a header, etc.). Also common is a strategy that invalidates that token after some period of inactivity.

This approach requires the client to interact with the server at regular intervals while their session is active to keep it active on the server side. This module provides a way for your application to regularly check on the user's session status, either to keep it alive or to respond to the user's session being ended by the server, whatever your particular workflow is.

This module is used in conjunction with `ng2-idle`, which can detect user activity (such as typing, touching, and scrolling) during long periods of active use that doesn't trigger any interaction with the server.

For example, if a user logs into an email application, the server may choose to reject session tokens after 5 minutes of inactivity to increase security. However, the user may take much more time than that to type out their email and send it. It would be frustrating to find you are logged out when you were actively using the software! `ng2-idle-keepalive` could be running in the background pinging the server every 5 minutes while they write that email, and then stop when they are inactive.

## Features

* Ping a remote HTTP endpoint using a configurable request.
* Pinging can be done manually or at a configurable interval.
* Emits `onPing` event for other handling of pinging (if the built-in HTTP request approach won't suffice).
* Emits `onPingResponse` event containing the configured HTTP request's response (so you can update your cached token or whatever else from the response).
* Can be used as the Keepalive implmentation used in `ng2-idle`'s `Idle` service.

## Getting Started

**NOTE ON ANGULAR**: This module is was written against Angular version `2.0.0-beta.3`. You may run into difficulties installing and running this module with prior versions.

Install and save `ng2-idle` and `ng2-idle-keepalive` as a dependency of your project.

     npm install ng2-idle ng2-idle-keepalive

Now you may configure `Keepalive` as a provider in your app's root `bootstrap` routine, which will make the service instance available across your entire application, include as a local dependency to a route, or make it a local dependency to a component or directive.

As an example: let's assume we have an application with this structure (omitting boilerplate, project artifacts, build tasks, etc.):

```
.
└── src
    ├── about
    │   └── components
    │       ├── about.e2e.ts
    │       ├── about.html
    │       ├── about.ts
    │       └── about.spec.ts
    ├── app
    │   └── components
    │       ├── app.css
    │       ├── app.e2e.ts
    │       ├── app.html
    │       ├── app.ts
    │       └── app.spec.ts
    ├── home
    │   └── components
    │       ├── home.css
    │       ├── home.html
    │       ├── home.ts
    │       ├── home.e2e.ts
    │       └── home.spec.ts
    ├── main.ts
    └── index.html

```

In `src/main.ts`, we bootstrap the application. It might look something like this:

```
import {provide} from 'angular2/core';
import {bootstrap} from 'angular2/platform/browser';
import {HTTP_PROVIDERS} from 'angular2/http'; // You'll need to import HTTP providers
import {IDLE_PROVIDERS} from 'ng2-idle/core'; // Import idle providers
import {KEEPALIVE_PROVIDERS} from 'ng2-idle-keepalive/core'; // You'll also need to import Keepalive providers

import {AppCmp} from './app/components/app'; // include your root application component

bootstrap(AppCmp, [
  // Keepalive depends on Http
  HTTP_PROVIDERS,
  // will register keepalive as the implementation Idle will use
  KEEPALIVE_PROVIDERS,
  // registers Idle
  IDLE_PROVIDERS
  // any additional providers your application needs
]);
```

In `src/app/components/app.ts`, we inject `Keepalive` and configure it for our application. This single instance of `Keepalive` will be used in all dependency hierarchies below the root (unless you choose to override them).

```
import {Component, ViewEncapsulation} from 'angular2/core';
import {
  RouteConfig,
  ROUTER_DIRECTIVES
} from 'angular2/router';

import {Idle, DEFAULT_INTERRUPTSOURCES} from 'ng2-idle/core';
import {Keepalive} from 'ng2-idle-keepalive/core';

import {HomeCmp} from '../../home/components/home';
import {AboutCmp} from '../../about/components/about';

@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  templateUrl: './app/components/app.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app/components/app.css'],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None,
  directives: [ROUTER_DIRECTIVES]
})
@RouteConfig([
  { path: '/', component: HomeCmp, as: 'Home' },
  { path: '/about', component: AboutCmp, as: 'About' }
])
export class AppCmp {

  // when this component is loaded, keepalive will be injected, configured, and start pinging right away
  constructor(private idle: Idle, private keepalive: Keepalive) {
    keepalive.onPing.subscribe(() => {
      console.log('Keepalive.ping() called!');
    });
    keepalive.interval(5);

    // sets an idle timeout of 5 seconds, for testing purposes.
    idle.setIdle(5);
    // sets a timeout period of 5 seconds. after 10 seconds of inactivity, the user will be considered timed out.
    idle.setTimeout(5);
    // sets the default interrupts, in this case, things like clicks, scrolls, touches to the document
    idle.setInterrupts(DEFAULT_INTERRUPTSOURCES);
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can have `Keepalive` ping an HTTP location by specifying a string URL or a `Request` object. Before start above, add these lines:

```
// will assume a GET request; you can specify a full Request object if you need something else, want to include headers, etc.
keepalive.request('/path/to/endpoint');
// this event is optional; it allows you to do something with the request's response if you'd like
keepalive.onPingRequest.subscribe(response => {
    console.log('Keepalive.ping() response status: ' + response.status);
  });
```

In `src/about/components/about.ts`, we see how you can interact with the `Keepalive` instance we created, to do things like stopping and starting pinging. You'll note that our subscription to `onPing` occurs in addition to the subscription we created when we configured the service in `AppCmp` above. **NOTE**: By default, when `Keepalive` is configured, it will automatically be used by `Idle` and consequently, `Idle` will automatically integrate with `Keepalive`. That means that `Idle` will assume responsibility for starting the keepalive when watching for idleness, and stopping it when the user goes idle or times out. If you are manually trying to manage `Keepalive` and feel that `Idle`'s default functionality is interferring, simply disable it using `Idle.setKeepaliveEnabled(false);`.

```
import {Component} from 'angular2/core';
import {CORE_DIRECTIVES} from 'angular2/common';
import {Keepalive} from 'ng2-idle-keepalive/core';
import {Idle} from 'ng2-idle/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'about',
  templateUrl: './about/components/about.html',
  directives: [CORE_DIRECTIVES]
})
export class AboutCmp {
  pings: Array<string> = new Array;

  constructor(idle: Idle, private keepalive: Keepalive) {
    // NOTE: since this example uses Idle, the next line is only needed for this example,
    // so that Idle will not start/stop keepalive automatically. In a normal project,
    // you would not need this unless your use case requires it.
    idle.setKeepaliveEnabled(false);

    // subscribe to the onPing event
    keepalive.onPing.subscribe(() => {
      this.pings.push(new Date().toISOString());
    });
  }

  clearPings(): void {
    this.pings.length = 0;
  }

  startPinging(): void {
    this.keepalive.start();
  }

  stopPinging(): void {
    this.keepalive.stop();
  }

  pingNow(): void {
    this.keepalive.ping();
  }

  isPinging(): boolean {
    return this.keepalive.isRunning();
  }
}
```

Here's the associated HTML template, `src/about/components/about.html`:

```
<p>Keepalive pings:</p>
<div>
  <button type="button" (click)="clearPings()">Clear list</button>
  <button type="button" (click)="startPinging()" [disabled]="isPinging()">Start</button>
  <button type="button" (click)="stopPinging()" [disabled]="!isPinging()">Stop</button>
  <button type="button" (click)="pingNow()">Ping</button>
</div>
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="#ping of pings">{{ping}}</li>
</ul>
```
